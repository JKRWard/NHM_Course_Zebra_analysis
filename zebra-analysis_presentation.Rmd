# Abstract

- Black with white stripes or white with black stripes? 
- Does anyone actually care?

<br>
<br>

# Introduction

- We investigated allometry in adult zebras using measurements taken from museum specimen skulls
    + We wondered what things might predict tooth length (don't we all?!)
- At this point we would usually:
    + write a bit about about why we are doing this study
    + maybe give you some nice zebra facts
- As we are lacking in zebra information, however, we have included a fun zebra gif for you

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
rawd <- read_csv("./data/2017-05-15_zebra-collection-data.csv")

# Make new column that collates the subspecies together using sub and a regular expression.
newzebra <- rawd %>% rowwise() %>% mutate(newspecies = sub("Equus_burchelli.*", "Equus_burchelli", species))
tbl_df(newzebra)
```

# Methods

## Sample description
- Adult zebra skulls were sampled from the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, UK

## Measurements
- Skull length was measured using a rule placed on the table
    + Each skull was placed beside the rule so that the ventral surface of the upper jaw was displayed
    + An exercise book was placed at the posterior and anterior of each skull and the distance between the two was measured (Figure 1)
<br>
![Figure 1. Zebra skull length measurement method](./images/zebra_skull_length_measurement-method.png)
<br>
<br>
- Premolar one (P1) on the left hand side of each skull was measured using a pair of calipers (Figure 2)
<br>
    +

## Statistical analyses
- Analyses of predictors of P1 molar length were conducted in `r R.version.string`

<br>
<br>

# Results

## Sample description

```{r}


```

- All skulls sampled (N = `r nrow(newzebra)`) were included in the analyses
    + The skulls belonged to 2 species of zebra; *Equus grevyi* (n = 4) and *Equus burchelli* (n = 24)
    + An unknown number of *Equus zebra* skulls were stuck in cupboards that would not unlock, and could not be included in the sample, as criminal damage is a bad thing
- The mean skull length was `r round(sapply(select(newzebra,skull_length),mean), digits = 1)` mm (SD = `r round(sapply(select(newzebra,skull_length),sd), digits=2)`) and the mean P1 premolar length was `r round(sapply(select(newzebra,tooth_p1_length),mean), digits = 2)` mm (SD = `r round(sapply(select(newzebra,tooth_p1_length),sd), digits = 3)`) 
- The full <a href="./data/2017-05-15_zebra-collection-data.csv", target = "_blank">dataset</a> and <a href="./data/Zebra_attributes.csv", target = "_blank">metadata</a> are available as supplementary material [insert copyright details here when we have had the session on it]

## Analysis 1: ANOVA predicting P1 molar length given skull length

- In the initial linear regression, P1 molar length was significantly predicted by skull length (Table 1)
- The model coefficients indicated that an increase in skull length of 1 cm predicted an increase in P1 molar length of 0.5 mm.

### Table 1. ANOVA results
```{r, echo = FALSE}
z_model <- lm(tooth_p1_length ~ skull_length, data = newzebra)
pander(tidy(anova(z_model)), justify = c('left','right','right','right','right', 'right'), style = 'rmarkdown')
```

### Figure 3. Model and coefficients
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Plot regression model

# Create dataframe containing line and 95% CI
min_newX <- min(subset(newzebra, select = skull_length))
max_newX <- max(subset(newzebra, select = skull_length))

newX <- expand.grid(skull_length = seq(from = min_newX, to = max_newX, length = 100))
newY <- predict(z_model, newdata = newX, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
addThese <- data.frame(newX, newY)
addThese <- rename(addThese, tooth_p1_length = fit)

# Plot model
ggplot(data = newzebra, aes(x = skull_length, y = tooth_p1_length)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, aes(color = newspecies)) +
  labs(x = "Skull length (mm)", y = "Length of first premolar (mm)") +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth(data = addThese, aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), stat = "identity")
pander(tidy(z_model), justify = c('left','right','right','right','right'), style = 'rmarkdown')
```

<br>
<br>

## Analysis 2: ANCOVA predicting P1 molar length given skull length and species
- we looked to see if skull length was statisticaly different amongst different species 
```{r, echo = F}
box <- ggplot(rawd) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(species, skull_length)) +
  coord_flip()

box2 <- ggplot(newzebra) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(newspecies, skull_length)) +
  coord_flip()


box
box2

```

- As mean skull length was numerically larger in *Equus Greyvi* than in *Equus Burchelli* (Figure 3), an ANCOVA predicting P1 molar length given skull length and species was run
- When the species were considered separately:
    + skull length did not predict P1 molar length in *Equus Burchelli* (Table 2, Figure 4).
    + the difference between species was not statistically significant, although there were only 4 *Equus Greyvi* skulls in the sample

```{r, echo = FALSE}

df <- newzebra
continuous_predictor_name <- "skull_length"
continuous_response_name <- "tooth_p1_length"
categorical_name <- "newspecies"
xlabel <- "Skull length (mm)"
ylabel <- "Length of first premolar (mm)"

# 1. PLOT your data
firstplot <- ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_point(aes_string(x = continuous_predictor_name, y = continuous_response_name, color = categorical_name)) +
  labs(x = xlabel, y = ylabel)
 
# 2. Make a model (with an interaction term)
mymodel <- lm(formula = as.formula(paste(continuous_response_name," ~ ",continuous_predictor_name," * ",categorical_name,sep="")), data = df)

# 3. Look at the assumptions
myautoplot <- autoplot(mymodel, smooth.colour = NA)

```
<br>

### Table 2. ANCOVA results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# 4. Look at the results
myanova <- anova(mymodel)

# 5. Add interpretation to your graph
max_x = max(subset(df, select = paste(continuous_predictor_name)))
min_x = min(subset(df, select = paste(continuous_predictor_name)))

my_formula1 <- paste(continuous_predictor_name," = seq(from = ",min_x,", to = ",max_x,", length = 100)",sep="")
# Just need to solve the problem of how to get the umique categories then this can be a function. levels will help
my_formula2 <- paste("newspecies = c(\"Equus_greyvi\",\"Equus_burchelli\")", sep="")

newX <- eval(parse(text = paste("expand.grid(",my_formula1, ", ", my_formula2, ")"))) 
newY <- predict(mymodel, newdata = newX, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)

addThese <- data.frame(newX, newY)
# Rename the fit column (always column 3)
colnames(addThese)[3] <- continuous_response_name

### Display ANOVA results
pander(tidy(anova(mymodel)), justify = c('left','right','right','right','right', 'right'), style = 'rmarkdown')
```

### Figure 4. Model and coefficients

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

newplot <- firstplot +
  geom_smooth(data = addThese, aes_string(x = continuous_predictor_name, y = continuous_response_name, ymin = "lwr", ymax = "upr", color = categorical_name), stat = "identity")
newplot

### Model coefficients
pander(tidy(mymodel), justify = c('left','right','right','right','right'), style = 'rmarkdown')

```

### Figure 5. Check of model assumptions (ANCOVA)
- The relatively small number of *Equus Greyvi* data points (larger skull sizes) looked over-fitted compared with the *Equus Burchelli* data points (Figure 5).
